# Scripts of Tegonal

There are scripts which we use over and over again in different projects.
As they might be usable for you as well, we are publishing them here.
Feel free to use it and report bugs if you should find one.

---

❗ You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding version.
For instance, the [README of v0.1.0](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts/tree/v0.1.0/README.md).

---

The scripts are ordered by topic:

- [script utilities](#script-utilities)
  - [Parse arguments](#parse-arguments)
  - [Replace Snippets](#replace-snippets)
  - [Update Documentation](#update-bash-documentation)

See also:
- [Contributors and contribute](#contributors-and-contribute)

# Script Utilities

The scripts under this topic are useful for bash programming as such.

## Parse arguments

We have two scripts helping in parsing arguments:
- parse-args.sh which expects named arguments
- parse-fn-args which is supposed to be sourced into a function

Following how an example how parse-args.sh is used:

<utility-parse-args>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in /home/runner/work/scripts/scripts/./src/utility/parse-args.sh -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

declare -A params
declare -A help

# declare the variables where the arguments shall be stored (used as identifier afterwards)
declare directory pattern

# define the regex which is used to identify the argument `directory`
params[directory]='-d|--directory'
# optional: define an explanation for the argument `directory` which will show up in `--help`
help[directory]='(optional) the working directory -- default: .'

# in case you use shellcheck then you need to suppress the warning for the last variable definition of params
# as shellcheck doesn't get that we are passing `params` to parseArguments ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
params[pattern]='-p|--pattern'
# `help` is used implicitly in parse-args, here shellcheck cannot know it and you need to disable the rule
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
help[pattern]='pattern used during analysis'

# optional: you can define examples which are included in the help text
declare examples
# `examples` is used implicitly in parse-args, here shellcheck cannot know it and you need to disable the rule
# shellcheck disable=SC2034
examples=$(cat << EOM
# analyse in the current directory using the specified pattern
analysis.sh -p "%{21}"
EOM
)

declare current_dir
current_dir="$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}"; )" &> /dev/null && pwd 2> /dev/null; )";
# Assuming parse-args.sh is in the same directory as your script
source "$current_dir/parse-args.sh"

parseArguments params "$@"
# in case there are optional parameters, then fill them in here before calling checkAllArgumentsSet
if ! [ -v directory ]; then directory="."; fi
checkAllArgumentsSet params

# pass your variables storing the arguments to other scripts
echo "d: $directory, p: $pattern"
```

</utility-parse-args>

Following an example how parse-fn-args.sh can be used:

<utility-parse-fn-args>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in /home/runner/work/scripts/scripts/./src/utility/parse-fn-args.sh -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

function myFunction() {
  # declare the variable you want to use and repeat in `declare args`
  declare command dir

  # args is used in parse-fn-args.sh thus:
  # shellcheck disable=SC2034
  declare args=(command dir)

  # Assuming parse-fn-args.sh is in the same directory as your script
  current_dir="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" &>/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)"
  . "$current_dir/parse-fn-args.sh"

  # pass your variables storing the arguments to other scripts
  echo "command: $command, dir: $dir"
}

function myFunctionWithVarargs() {

  # in case you want to use a vararg parameter as last parameter then name your last parameter for `args` varargs:

  declare command dir varargs
  # shellcheck disable=SC2034
  declare args=(command dir varargs)

  # Assuming parse-fn-args.sh is in the same directory as your script
  current_dir="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" &>/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)"
  . "$current_dir/parse-fn-args.sh"

  # use varargs in another script
  echo "${varargs[0]}"

}
```

</utility-parse-fn-args>

## Replace Snippets

If you want to include some code in markdown files (or any other HTML-like file) then replace-snippet.sh could come in handy.
Following an example

<utility-replace-snippet>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in /home/runner/work/scripts/scripts/./src/utility/replace-snippet.sh -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# Assuming replace-snippet.sh is in the same directory as your script
current_dir="$( cd -- "$( dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}"; )" &> /dev/null && pwd 2> /dev/null; )"
source "$current_dir/replace-snippet.sh"

declare file
file=$(mktemp)
echo "<my-script></my-script>" > "$file"

# replaceSnippet file id dir pattern snippet
replaceSnippet my-script.sh my-script-help "$(dirname "$file")" "$(basename "$file")" "$(echo "replace with your command" | grep "command")"

echo "content"
cat "$file"

# will search for <my-script-help>...</my-script-help> in the temp file and replace it with
# <my-script-help>
#
# <!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in my-snippet -->
# ```
# output of executing $(myCommand)
# ```
# </my-script-help>
```

</utility-replace-snippet>

## Update Bash documentation

Updates the `Usage` section of a bash file based on a sibling doc which is named *.doc.sh (e.g foo.sh and foo.doc.sh).
Moreover, it uses [Replace Snippets](#replace-snippets) to update a corresponding snippet in the specified files.
