# Scripts of Tegonal

There are scripts which we use over and over again in different projects.
As they might be usable for you as well, we are publishing them here.
Feel free to use it and report bugs if you should find one.

---
‚ùó You are taking a _sneak peek_ at the next version.
Please have a look at the README of the git tag in case you are looking for the documentation of the corresponding
version.
For instance, the [README of v1.2.1](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts/tree/v1.2.1/README.md).

# Installation

We recommend you pull the scripts with the help of [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt).  
Alternatively you can
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v1.2.1-%23007ec6)](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts/releases/tag/v1.2.1)
the sources.

Following the commands you need to execute to set up tegonal scripts via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt).

```bash
gt remote add -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts
````

Now you can pull the scripts you want via:

```bash
export TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION="v1.2.1"
gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -t "$TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION" -p ...
```

Note that dependencies have to be pulled manually and almost all scripts depend on `src/setup.sh`
which in turn depends on `src/utility/source-once.sh` and this one depends on `src/utility/log.sh`.
Many of the scripts depend on further scripts located in `src/utility`.
Therefore, for simplicity reasons, we recommend you pull `src/setup.sh` and all files in `src/utility` in addition:

```
export TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION="v1.2.1" 
gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -t "$TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION" -p src/setup.sh
gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -t "$TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION" -p src/utility/
```

## Sourcing functions

We recommend you use the following code at the beginning of your script in case you want to `source` a file/function
(in the example below we want to use tegonal's io functions located in `utility/io.sh`):

<setup>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/setup.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit

if ! [[ -v dir_of_tegonal_scripts ]]; then
	# Assumes your script is in (root is project folder) e.g. /src or /scripts and
	# the tegonal scripts have been pulled via gt and put into /lib/tegonal-scripts
	dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
	source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
fi

sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/io.sh"
```

</setup>

Note that `source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh"` will automatically source `utility/source-once.sh` and `utility/log.sh`

# Continuous Integration
The scripts under this topic (in directory `ci`) help out in performing CI steps.

## Install shellcheck

Installs shellcheck v0.8.0.  
Most likely used together with [runShellcheck](#runshellcheck).
Following an example:
  
<ci-install-shellcheck>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/install-shellcheck.sh.doc -->
```bash
# run the install-shellcheck.sh in your github/gitlab workflow
# for instance, assuming you fetched this file via gt and remote name is tegonal-scripts
# then in a github workflow you would have

jobs:
  steps:
    - name: install shellcheck v0.9.0
      run: ./lib/tegonal-scripts/src/ci/install-shellcheck.sh
    # and most likely as well
    - name: run shellcheck
      run: ./scripts/run-shellcheck.sh
```

</ci-install-shellcheck>

## Install shellspec

<ci-install-shellspec>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/install-shellspec.sh.doc -->
```bash
# run the install-shellcheck.sh in your github/gitlab workflow
# for instance, assuming you fetched this file via gt and remote name is tegonal-scripts
# then in a github workflow you would have

jobs:
  steps:
    - name: install shellspec v0.28.1
      run: ./lib/tegonal-scripts/src/ci/install-shellspec.sh
    # and most likely as well
    - name: run shellspec
      run: shellspec
```

</ci-install-shellspec>

## Jelastic
The scripts under this topic (in directory `ci/jelastic`) help out when dealing with jelastic cli

### Deploy to jelastic

Helper function which performs a signin and redeploycontainers

<ci-jelastic-deploy>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

# typically you would define those via secrets (GitHub) or Variables (Gitlab)
JELASTIC_LOGIN='my-user'
JELASTIC_PASSWORD='access-token'
JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL='https://...'

# the label of the docker image as pushed to the docker registry configured for the environment test
DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION=bebea131

# executes signin and redeploycontainers via jelastic_cli
"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh" -l "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" -p "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD" -u "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" -e "test" -n cp -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION"

# you can also source
sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh"
jelastic_deploy -l "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" -p "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD" -u "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" -e "test" -n cp -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION"
```

</ci-jelastic-deploy>

In a GitHub workflow you would use it as follows:
```yaml
jobs:
  steps:
    - name: deploy shellcheck v0.8.0
      run: |
        ./lib/tegonal-scripts/src/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh \
          -l "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" -p "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD" -u "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" \
          -e "test" -n cp \
          -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION"
```

Help:

<ci-jelastic-deploy-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh -->
```text
Parameters:
-l|--login       The user who logs in
-p|--password    The access token of the user
-u|--url         The platformUrl to the jelastic instance
-e|--env         The environment to use
-n|--nodeGroup   The nodeGroup to use
-t|--tag         The tag which shall be deployed

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

INFO: Version of deploy.sh is:
v1.3.0-SNAPSHOT
```

</ci-jelastic-deploy-help>

### Jelastic utils

The most important functions are defined in this file: jelastic_signin which in turn uses the generic jelastic_exec 

<ci-jelastic-utils>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/jelastic/utils.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/ci/jelastic/jelastic-utils.sh"

# typically you would define those via secrets (GitHub) or Variables (Gitlab)
JELASTIC_LOGIN='my-user'
JELASTIC_PASSWORD='access-token'
JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL='https://...'

# before doing anything with jelastic cli, you need to signin
# this is just a helper function you could also use jelastic_exec and pass users/authentication/signin as command
jelastic_signin "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD"

# generic utility which executes the jelastic_cli with the corresponding command and args but,
# in contrast to the cli, it checks whether the response contained `result: 0` or not
jelastic_exec "environment/control/redeploycontainers" --envName "test" --nodeGroup "cp" --tag "a123e2"
```

</ci-jelastic-utils>

# Quality Assurance

The scripts under this topic (in directory `qa`) perform checks or execute qa tools.

## runShellcheck

A function which expects the name of an array of dirs as first argument and a source path as second argument (which is
passed to shellcheck via -P parameter). It then executes shellcheck for each *.sh in these directories with predefined
settings for shellcheck.

<qa-run-shellcheck>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/qa/run-shellcheck.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/qa/run-shellcheck.sh"

# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to runShellcheck
declare -a dirs=(
	"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
	"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/../scripts"
	"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/../spec"
)
declare sourcePath="$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
runShellcheck dirs "$sourcePath"
```

</qa-run-shellcheck>

# Releasing

The scripts under this topic (in directory `releasing`) perform some steps of your release process.

## Update Version in README

Updates the version used in download badges and in the sneak peek banner.
Requires that you follow one of the following schemas for the download badges:

```
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-<YOUR_VERSION>-%23<YOUR_COLOR>)](<ANY_URL>/v0.2.0)
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-<YOUR_VERSION>-%23<YOUR_COLOR>)](<ANY_URL>=v0.2.0)
```

And it searches for the following text for the sneak peek banner:

```
For instance, the [README of <YOUR_VERSION>](<ANY_URL>/tree/<YOUR_VERSION>/...) 
```

## Release Files

Script which releases a version for a repository containing files which don't need to be compiled or packaged.
It is based on some conventions (see src/releasing/release-files.sh for more details):

- expects a version in format vX.Y.Z(-RC...)
- main is your default branch
- requires you to have a /scripts folder in your project root which contains:
  - before-pr.sh which provides a parameterless function `beforePr` and can be sourced (add `${__SOURCED__:+return}` before executing `beforePr`)
  - prepare-next-dev-cycle.sh which provides function `prepareNextDevCycle` with parameters `-v` for version
    and `-p` for additionalPattern (see source for more detail). Also, this file needs to be sourceable.
    Typically, you will use [Prepare Files next dev cycle](#prepare-files-next-dev-cycle) inside which deals with things
    like update to SNAPSHOT version in header files etc.
- there is a public key defined at .gt/signing-key.public.asc which will be used
  to verify the signatures which will be created

It then includes the following steps:
- some checks regarding git status 
- `beforePr`
- rewrite sneak-peek banner
- toggle main/release sections in README
- update version in download badges and sneak-peek banner in README as well as   
  replace additional occurrences defined via `-p|--pattern` (see output of `--help` further below for further details)
- update version in script headers in /src and /scripts of your project
- (optional) sources ./scripts/additional-release-files-preparations.sh if it exists
- `beforePr`
- sign files via GPG where you define which files via `--sign-fn`
- commit
- `prepareNextDevCycle`
  - (optional) sources ./scripts/additional-prepare-files-next-dev-cycle-steps.sh if it exists
- push changes
- tag and push tag

Useful if you want to release e.g. scripts which can then be fetched via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt).

Note, if your beforePr or your additional steps modifies beforePr or a file it depends on, then you need to source
those files manually in your additional steps.

## Parse arguments

We provide three scripts helping in parsing command line arguments:

- parse-args.sh which expects named arguments
- parse-fn-args which is intended to be used in functions and only supports positional arguments
- parse-command.sh which simplifies the delegation to corresponding command functions

### parse-args.sh

Full usage example:

<utility-parse-args>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/parse-args.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit

# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/parse-args.sh"

# declare all parameter names here (used as identifier afterwards)
declare pattern version directory

# parameter definitions where each parameter definition consists of three values (separated via space)
# VARIABLE_NAME PATTERN HELP_TEXT
# where the HELP_TEXT is optional in the sense of that you can use an empty string
# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to parseArguments
declare params=(
	pattern '-p|--pattern' ''
	version '-v' 'the version'
	directory '-d|--directory' '(optional) the working directory -- default: .'
)
# optional: you can define examples which are included in the help text -- use an empty string for no example
declare examples
# `examples` is used implicitly in parse-args, here shellcheck cannot know it and you need to disable the rule
examples=$(
	cat <<EOM
# analyse in the current directory using the specified pattern
analysis.sh -p "%{21}" -v v0.1.0
EOM
)

parseArguments params "$examples" "$MY_LIB_VERSION" "$@"
# in case there are optional parameters, then fill them in here before calling exitIfNotAllArgumentsSet
if ! [[ -v directory ]]; then directory="."; fi
exitIfNotAllArgumentsSet params "$examples" "$MY_LIB_VERSION"

# pass your variables storing the arguments to other scripts
echo "p: $pattern, v: $version, d: $directory"
```

</utility-parse-args>

### parse-fn-args.sh

Full usage example:

<utility-parse-fn-args>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/parse-fn-args.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

	source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
fi
sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/parse-fn-args.sh"

function myFunction() {
	# declare the variable you want to use and repeat in `declare params`
	local command dir

	# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to parseFnArgs
	local -ra params=(command dir)
	parseFnArgs params "$@"

	# pass your variables storing the arguments to other scripts
	echo "command: $command, dir: $dir"
}

function myFunctionWithVarargs() {

	# in case you want to use a vararg parameter as last parameter then name your last parameter for `params` varargs:
	local command dir varargs
	# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to parseFnArgs
	local -ra params=(command dir varargs)
	parseFnArgs params "$@"

	# use varargs in another script
	echo "command: $command, dir: $dir, varargs: ${varargs*}"
}
```

</utility-parse-fn-args>

### parse-commands.sh

Full usage example:

<utility-parse-commands>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/parse-commands.sh.doc -->

sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/parse-commands.sh"

# command definitions where each command definition consists of two values (separated via space)
# COMMAND_NAME HELP_TEXT

declare commands=(
	add 'command to add people to your list'

)

# the function which is responsible to load the corresponding file which contains the function of this particular command
function sourceCommand() {

}

parseCommands commands "$MY_LIB_VERSION" sourceCommand my_lib_ "$@"
```

}
```

</utility-parse-utils>

## Recursive `declare -p`

Utility function to find out the initial `declare` statement after following `declare -n` statements

<utility-recursive-declare-p>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/recursive-declare-p.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash

# declare -i tmp="1"
```

</utility-recursive-declare-p>

## Replace Snippets

If you want to include some code in markdown files (or any other HTML-like file) then replace-snippet.sh could come in
handy.

Full usage example:

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/replace-snippet.sh"

declare file
file=$(mktemp)
echo "<my-script></my-script>" > "$file"

declare dir fileName output
dir=$(dirname "$file")
fileName=$(basename "$file")
output=$(echo "replace with your command" | grep "command")

# replaceSnippet file id dir pattern snippet
replaceSnippet my-script.sh my-script-help "$dir" "$fileName" "$output"

echo "content"
cat "$file"

# will search for <my-script-help>...</my-script-help> in the temp file and replace it with

## Source once

Establishes a guard by creating a variable based on the file which shall be sourced.

<utility-source-once>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/source-once.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/source-once.sh"

sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # creates a variable named sourceOnceGuard_foo__sh which acts as guard and sources foo.sh
sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # will source nothing as sourceOnceGuard_foo__sh is already defined
unset sourceOnceGuard_foo__sh          # unsets the guard
sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # is sourced again and the guard established
# you can also use sourceAlways instead of unsetting and using sourceOnce.
sourceAlways "foo.sh"

# creates a variable named sourceOnceGuard_bar__foo__sh which acts as guard and sources bar/foo.sh
sourceOnce "bar/foo.sh"

# will source nothing, only the parent dir + file is used as identifier
# i.e. the corresponding guard is sourceOnceGuard_bar__foo__sh and thus this file is not sourced
sourceOnce "asdf/bar/foo.sh"

declare guard
guard=$(determineSourceOnceGuard "src/bar.sh")
# In case you don't want that a certain file is sourced, then you can define the guard yourself
# this will prevent that */src/bar.sh is sourced
printf -v "$guard" "%s" "true"
```

</utility-source-once>

## Update Bash documentation

Updates the `Usage` section of a bash file based on a sibling doc which is named *.doc.sh (e.g foo.sh and foo.doc.sh).
Moreover, it uses [Replace Snippets](#replace-snippets) to update a corresponding snippet in the specified files.

Full usage example:

<utility-update-bash-docu>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/update-bash-docu.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/update-bash-docu.sh"

find . -name "*.sh" \
	-not -name "*.doc.sh" \
	-print0 |
	while read -r -d $'\0' script; do
		declare script="${script:2}"
		updateBashDocumentation "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/$script" "${script////-}" . README.md
	done
```

</utility-update-bash-docu>
