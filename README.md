# Scripts of Tegonal

There are scripts which we use over and over again in different projects.
As they might be usable for you as well, we are publishing them here.
Feel free to use it and report bugs if you should find one.

<!---
❗ You are taking a *sneak peek* at the next version. It could be that some features you find on this page are not
released yet.  
Please have a look at the README of the corresponding release/git tag. Latest
version: [README of v4.4.2](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts/tree/v4.4.2/README.md).

# Installation

We recommend you pull the scripts with the help of [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt).  
Alternatively you can
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-v4.4.2-%23007ec6)](https://github.com/tegonal/scripts/releases/tag/v4.4.2)
the sources.

Following the commands you need to execute to set up tegonal scripts via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt).

```bash
gt remote add -r tegonal-scripts -u https://github.com/tegonal/scripts
````

Now you can pull the scripts you want via:

```bash
export TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION="v4.4.2"
gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -t "$TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION" -p ...
```

Note that dependencies have to be pulled manually and almost all scripts depend on `src/setup.sh`
which in turn depends on `src/utility/source-once.sh` and this one depends on `src/utility/log.sh`.
Many of the scripts depend on further scripts located in `src/utility`.
Therefore, for simplicity reasons, we recommend you pull `src/setup.sh` and all files in `src/utility` in addition:

```
export TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION="v4.4.2" 
gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -t "$TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION" -p src/setup.sh
gt pull -r tegonal-scripts -t "$TEGONAL_SCRIPTS_VERSION" -p src/utility/
```

## Sourcing functions

We recommend you use the following code at the beginning of your script in case you want to `source` a file/function
(in the example below we want to use tegonal's io functions located in `utility/io.sh`):

<setup>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/setup.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit

if ! [[ -v dir_of_tegonal_scripts ]]; then
	# Assumes your script is in (root is project folder) e.g. /src or /scripts and
	# the tegonal scripts have been pulled via gt and put into /lib/tegonal-scripts
	dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
	source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
fi

sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/io.sh"
```

</setup>

Note that `source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh"` will automatically source `utility/source-once.sh`
and `utility/log.sh`

# Continuous Integration

The scripts under this topic (in directory `ci`) help out in performing CI steps.

## Install shellcheck

Installs shellcheck. Most likely, you want to use it together with [runShellcheck](#runshellcheck).
Following an example:

<ci-install-shellcheck>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/install-shellcheck.sh.doc -->
```bash
# run the install-shellcheck.sh in your github/gitlab workflow
# for instance, assuming you fetched this file via gt and remote name is tegonal-scripts
# then in a github workflow you would have

jobs:
  steps:
    - name: install shellcheck
      run: ./lib/tegonal-scripts/src/ci/install-shellcheck.sh
    # and most likely as well
    - name: run shellcheck
      run: ./scripts/run-shellcheck.sh
```

</ci-install-shellcheck>

## Install shellspec

<ci-install-shellspec>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/install-shellspec.sh.doc -->
```bash
# run the install-shellspec in your github/gitlab workflow
# for instance, assuming you fetched this file via gt and remote name is tegonal-scripts
# then in a github workflow you would have

jobs:
  steps:
    - name: install shellspec
      run: ./lib/tegonal-scripts/src/ci/install-shellspec.sh
    # and most likely as well
    - name: run shellspec
      run: shellspec
```

</ci-install-shellspec>

## Jelastic

The scripts under this topic (in directory `ci/jelastic`) help out when dealing with jelastic cli

### Deploy to jelastic

Helper function which performs a signin and redeploycontainers

<ci-jelastic-deploy>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

# typically you would define those via secrets (GitHub) or Variables (Gitlab)
JELASTIC_LOGIN='my-user'
JELASTIC_PASSWORD='access-token'
JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL='https://...'

# the label of the docker image as pushed to the docker registry configured for the environment test
DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION=bebea131

# executes signin and redeploycontainers via jelastic_cli
"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh" -l "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" -p "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD" -u "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" -e "test" -n cp -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION"

# you can also source
sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh"
jelastic_deploy -l "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" -p "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD" -u "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" -e "test" -n cp -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION"
```

</ci-jelastic-deploy>

In a GitHub workflow you would use it as follows:

```yaml
jobs:
  steps:
    - name: deploy shellcheck v0.8.0
      run: |
        ./lib/tegonal-scripts/src/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh \
          -l "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" -p "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD" -u "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" \
          -e "test" -n cp \
          -t "$DOCKER_IMAGE_VERSION"
```

Help:

<ci-jelastic-deploy-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/jelastic/deploy.sh -->
```text
Parameters:
-l|--login       The user who logs in
-p|--password    The access token of the user
-u|--url         The platformUrl to the jelastic instance
-e|--env         The environment to use
-n|--nodeGroup   The nodeGroup to use
-t|--tag         The tag which shall be deployed

--help     prints this help
--version  prints the version of this script

INFO: Version of deploy.sh is:
v4.4.2
```

</ci-jelastic-deploy-help>

### Jelastic utils

The most important functions are defined in this file: jelastic_signin which in turn uses the generic jelastic_exec

<ci-jelastic-utils>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/ci/jelastic/utils.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/ci/jelastic/jelastic-utils.sh"

# typically you would define those via secrets (GitHub) or Variables (Gitlab)
JELASTIC_LOGIN='my-user'
JELASTIC_PASSWORD='access-token'
JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL='https://...'

# before doing anything with jelastic cli, you need to signin
# this is just a helper function you could also use jelastic_exec and pass users/authentication/signin as command
jelastic_signin "$JELASTIC_PLATFORM_URL" "$JELASTIC_LOGIN" "$JELASTIC_PASSWORD"

# generic utility which executes the jelastic_cli with the corresponding command and args but,
# in contrast to the cli, it checks whether the response contained `result: 0` or not
jelastic_exec "environment/control/redeploycontainers" --envName "test" --nodeGroup "cp" --tag "a123e2"
```

</ci-jelastic-utils>

# Quality Assurance

The scripts under this topic (in directory `qa`) perform checks or execute qa tools.

## runShellcheck

A function which expects the name of an array of dirs as first argument and a source path as second argument (which is
passed to shellcheck via -P parameter). It then executes shellcheck for each *.sh in these directories with predefined
settings for shellcheck.

<qa-run-shellcheck>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/qa/run-shellcheck.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/qa/run-shellcheck.sh"

# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to runShellcheck
declare -a dirs=(
	"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
	"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/../scripts"
	"$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/../spec"
)
declare sourcePath="$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"
runShellcheck dirs "$sourcePath"
```

</qa-run-shellcheck>

## runShellCheck on pull-hooks.sh

If you are using [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt) then you most likely want to be sure that your pull-hook.sh files 
don't contain shell issues, you can use the function `runShellCheckPullHooks` which analyses all pull-hook.sh files
in the remotes dir of gt using the $dir_of_tegonal_scripts as source path.

<qa-run-shellcheck-pull-hooks>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/qa/run-shellcheck-pull-hooks.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/qa/run-shellcheck-pull-hooks.sh"

# pass the working directory of gt which usually is .gt in the root of your repository
runShellcheckPullHooks ".gt"
```

</qa-run-shellcheck-pull-hooks>



## runShellSpecIfInstalled

Utility function which checks if shellspec is installed and if so executes it and prints a warning otherwise.
Intended to be used in before-pr.sh where contributors shall not be forced to have shellspec installed

<qa-run-shellspec-if-installed>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/qa/run-shellspec-if-installed.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/qa/run-shellspec-if-installed.sh"

runShellspecIfInstalled

# you can also pass arguments to shellspec
runShellspecIfInstalled --jobs 2
```

</qa-run-shellspec-if-installed>

# Releasing

The scripts under this topic (in directory `releasing`) perform some steps of your release process.

## Release Files

Script which releases a version for a repository containing files which don't need to be compiled or packaged.
Instead, they will be signed by a specified gpg key where its public key, defined in .gt/signing-key.public.asc,
will be used to verify the signatures.

This script is useful if you want to release e.g. scripts which can then be fetched
via [gt](https://github.com/tegonal/gt).

It uses [release-template](#release-template) internally and thus applies the same conventions + the mentioned public
key
which needs to be defined in .gt/signing-key.public.asc

It executes the same steps as in release-template where scripts located in projectRootDir/src are also updated
regarding the version and as explained, in the releaseHook, it signs the files the given --sign-fn finds.

## Prepare Files Next Dev Cycle

Script which prepares files for a next development cycle (typically used together with [release files](#release-files)).
it uses the [prepare next dev cycle template](#prepare-next-dev-cycle-template) and thus is based on the same conventions.

## Release Template

Defines a release process template where some conventions are defined:

- expects a version in format vX.Y.Z(-RC...)
- main is your default branch (or you use --branch to define another)
- requires you to have a function beforePr in scope (or you define another one via --before-pr-fn)
- requires you to have a function prepareNextDevCycle in scope (or you define another one via
  --prepare-next-dev-cycle-fn)

It then executes the following steps:


- [git pre-release checks](#git-pre-release-checks)
- check `beforePrFn` can be executed without problems
- [update version common release steps](#update-version-common-release-steps)
- call the afterVersionUpdateHook if defined
-  check again `beforePrFn`  is not broken
- call the releaseHook

## git Pre-Release checks

checks if the repo is ready to be released for a given version

- expects a version in format vX.Y.Z(-RC...)
- you are currently on `main` (or use `--branch` to define a different expected branch)
- your branch is up-to-date with `origin`

it assists you in pulling/rebasing etc. in case you are on the wrong branch or behind origin.

## SBT Sonatype publish

Assumes you have configured your sbt project to publish to sonatype (or any other repo) where you have defined to 
use SONATYPE_USER and SONATYPE_PW as env vars for your credentials. I.e. your build.sbt file will contain something like:
```sbt
credentials += Credentials(
  "Sonatype Nexus Repository Manager",
  "oss.sonatype.org",
  sys.env.getOrElse("SONATYPE_USER", ""),
  sys.env.getOrElse("SONATYPE_PW", "")
)
```

This script asks to fill in those to env vars if not already given an calls `sbt publishSigned` afterwards passing
them in without exporting them.

## Update Version Common Steps

Performs several `releasing` scripts defined in the following sections:

- Updates the version in *.sh (see [Update Version in bash scripts](#update-version-in-bash-scripts))
  defined in /scripts and .gt/**/pull-hook.sh
- Updates the version in .github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/**.y(a)ml files (
  see [Update Version in issue templates](#update-version-in-issue-templates))
- Updates the version in the README.md (see next section [Update Version in README](#update-version-in-readme)).
- [activates the release section and hides the main section](#toggle-mainrelease-sections) if `-for-release` is `true` (the opposite otherwise)
- [hides the sneak-peek banner](#hideshow-sneak-peek-banner) (or shows it if `--for-release` is `false`)

Help:

<releasing-update-version-common-steps-help>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/releasing/update-version-common-steps.sh -->

Parameters:
--for-release   true if update is for release in which case we hide the sneak-peek banner and toggle sections for release, if false then we show the sneak-peek banner and toggle the section for development
-v              The version to release in the format vX.Y.Z(-RC...)
--project-dir   (optional) The projects directory -- default: .
-p|--pattern    (optional) pattern which is used in a perl command (separator /) to search & replace additional occurrences. It should define two match groups and the replace operation looks as follows: \${1}$version\${2}

## Update Version in README

Updates the version used in download badges and in the sneak peek banner.
Requires that you follow one of the following schemas for the download badges:

```
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-<YOUR_VERSION>-%23<YOUR_COLOR>)](<ANY_URL>/v0.2.0)
[![Download](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download-<YOUR_VERSION>-%23<YOUR_COLOR>)](<ANY_URL>=v0.2.0)
```

And it searches for the following text for the sneak peek banner:

```
For instance, the [README of v2.0.0](<ANY_URL>/tree/v2.0.0/...) 
```

## Parse arguments

We provide three scripts helping in parsing command line arguments:

- parse-args.sh which expects named arguments
- parse-fn-args which is intended to be used in functions and only supports positional arguments
- parse-command.sh which simplifies the delegation to corresponding command functions

### parse-args.sh

Full usage example:

<utility-parse-args>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/parse-args.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
MY_LIB_VERSION="v1.1.0"

# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/parse-args.sh"

# declare all parameter names here (used as identifier afterwards)
declare pattern version directory

# parameter definitions where each parameter definition consists of three values (separated via space)
# VARIABLE_NAME PATTERN HELP_TEXT
# where the HELP_TEXT is optional in the sense of that you can use an empty string
# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to parseArguments
declare params=(
	pattern '-p|--pattern' ''
	version '-v' 'the version'
	directory '-d|--directory' '(optional) the working directory -- default: .'
)
# optional: you can define examples which are included in the help text -- use an empty string for no example
declare examples
# `examples` is used implicitly in parse-args, here shellcheck cannot know it and you need to disable the rule
examples=$(
	cat <<EOM
# analyse in the current directory using the specified pattern
analysis.sh -p "%{21}" -v v0.1.0
EOM
)

parseArguments params "$examples" "$MY_LIB_VERSION" "$@"
# in case there are optional parameters, then fill them in here before calling exitIfNotAllArgumentsSet
if ! [[ -v directory ]]; then directory="."; fi
exitIfNotAllArgumentsSet params "$examples" "$MY_LIB_VERSION"

# pass your variables storing the arguments to other scripts
echo "p: $pattern, v: $version, d: $directory"
```

</utility-parse-args>

### parse-fn-args.sh

Full usage example:

<utility-parse-fn-args>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/parse-fn-args.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit

if ! [[ -v dir_of_tegonal_scripts ]]; then
	# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly

fi
sourceOnce "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/parse-fn-args.sh"

function myFunction() {
	# declare the variable you want to use and repeat in `declare params`
	local command dir

	# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to parseFnArgs
	local -ra params=(command dir)
	parseFnArgs params "$@"

	# pass your variables storing the arguments to other scripts
	echo "command: $command, dir: $dir"
}

function myFunctionWithVarargs() {

	# in case you want to use a vararg parameter as last parameter then name your last parameter for `params` varargs:
	local command dir varargs
	# shellcheck disable=SC2034   # is passed by name to parseFnArgs
	local -ra params=(command dir varargs)
	parseFnArgs params "$@"

	# use varargs in another script
	echo "command: $command, dir: $dir, varargs: ${varargs*}"
}
```

</utility-parse-fn-args>

### parse-commands.sh

}

# pass:
# 1. supported commands
# 2. version which shall be shown in --version and --help
# 3. source command, responsible to load the files
# 4. the prefix used for the commands. e.g. command show with prefix my_lib_ results in calling a

# 5. arguments passed to the corresponding function
parseCommands commands "$MY_LIB_VERSION" sourceCommand "my_lib_" "$@"

	# makes only sense if we already know that this method is called indirectly
	printVersion "$MY_LIBRARY_VERSION" 3
}
```

</utility-parse-utils>

## Recursive `declare -p`

Utility function to find out the initial `declare` statement after following `declare -n` statements

## Replace Snippets

If you want to include some code in markdown files (or any other HTML-like file) then replace-snippet.sh could come in
handy.

## Source once

Establishes a guard by creating a variable based on the file which shall be sourced.

<utility-source-once>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/source-once.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/source-once.sh"

sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # creates a variable named sourceOnceGuard_foo__sh which acts as guard and sources foo.sh
sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # will source nothing as sourceOnceGuard_foo__sh is already defined
unset sourceOnceGuard_foo__sh          # unsets the guard
sourceOnce "foo.sh"    # is sourced again and the guard established
# you can also use sourceAlways instead of unsetting and using sourceOnce.
sourceAlways "foo.sh"

# creates a variable named sourceOnceGuard_bar__foo__sh which acts as guard and sources bar/foo.sh
sourceOnce "bar/foo.sh"

# will source nothing, only the parent dir + file is used as identifier
# i.e. the corresponding guard is sourceOnceGuard_bar__foo__sh and thus this file is not sourced
sourceOnce "asdf/bar/foo.sh"

declare guard
guard=$(determineSourceOnceGuard "src/bar.sh")
# In case you don't want that a certain file is sourced, then you can define the guard yourself
# this will prevent that */src/bar.sh is sourced
printf -v "$guard" "%s" "true"
```

## string utils

String processing utils

<utility-string-utils>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/string-utils.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/string-utils.sh"

# will output v4\.2\.0
escapeRegex "v4.2.0"

# useful in combination with grep which does not support literal searches:
# escapes to tegonal\+
pattern=$(escapeRegex "tegonal+")
grep -E "$pattern"
```

</utility-string-utils>


## Update Bash documentation

Updates the `Usage` section of a bash file based on a sibling doc which is named *.doc.sh (e.g foo.sh and foo.doc.sh).
Moreover, it uses [Replace Snippets](#replace-snippets) to update a corresponding snippet in the specified files.

Full usage example:

<utility-update-bash-docu>

<!-- auto-generated, do not modify here but in src/utility/update-bash-docu.sh.doc -->
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail
shopt -s inherit_errexit
# Assumes tegonal's scripts were fetched with gt - adjust location accordingly
dir_of_tegonal_scripts="$(cd -- "$(dirname -- "${BASH_SOURCE[0]:-$0}")" >/dev/null && pwd 2>/dev/null)/../lib/tegonal-scripts/src"
source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/setup.sh" "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts"

source "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/utility/update-bash-docu.sh"

find . -name "*.sh" \
	-not -name "*.doc.sh" \
	-print0 |
	while read -r -d $'\0' script; do
		declare script="${script:2}"
		updateBashDocumentation "$dir_of_tegonal_scripts/$script" "${script////-}" . README.md
	done
```

</utility-update-bash-docu>
