#######  Description  #############
#
# Checks that releasing a certain version (creating a corresponding git tag) makes sense: We check:
#  - the version follows the format vX.Y.Z(-RC...)
#  - there are no uncommitted changes
#  - checks current branch is `main` (we assume the convention that main is your default branch)
#  - the desired version does not exist as tag locally or on remote
